user_description: ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ashish and I'm from India. I'm a Windows focused Software developer. I like checking out open source projects and sharing my own code on Github. I have experience working in agile environments and am a convinced advocate of clean code. I automate repetitive processes on my computer via bash or python scripting. I am passionate about investing and I'm planning to share my experiences on a blog later on.
